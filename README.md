# AAF-for-PINNs
Source Code-Simple yet effective adaptive activation functions for physics-informed neural networks.
Different files represent the source codes of different examples in the paper. 
All models are trained on a platform of NVIDIA Quadro P520 GPU. Table 1 also shows the test results of models after training on the platform of NVIDIA Quadro P520 GPU with a fixed random seed=42. The result_data file saves the weights of the models, the weights of the adaptive activation functions, etc., so that readers are able to directly load the models and weights by using net and L2_relative_error for testing. Readers can also train and test through solver_poisson_1d, Burgers_adaptive_weights, and solver_PINN_GPU files, yet the training of NNs itself has some randomness. In this paper, we repeatedly and randomly train the models and collect the inference results of PINNs. We report the mean and standard deviation of the L2 relative error. In addition, comparison_loss, mean_std, and L2_relative_error files are relevant parts about the post-processing, which can be utilized for drawing the loss function, calculating the mean and standard deviation, etc.
